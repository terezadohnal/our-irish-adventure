                    <p class="content-text-1">First time meeting the giant Cliffs. The Cliffs of Moher. Covered by a greeny land, surrounded by the wild Atlantic Ocean. Unbelievable height. Neverending walk along the coast. Sunlight on my back. Butterflies in my stomach.</p>

                    <p class="content-text-3">Firstly, the Limerick streets seemed to be very dark and lonely. My stomach started to ache and vision of an upcomming year was fading away. Then there was Rift. The coffeeshop. Which made our stay in Ireland so special and unique.</p>

                    <p class="content-text-4">Wide and empty land. Huge national parc with a speacial atmosphere. Some places looks better when the sun clouds come out. You can see the nature clearly and not blinded by the sun. The river gets darker and grass gets greener.</p>

                    <p class="content-text-5">The mid of April is the signal of an upcomming spring. Days are getting longer and sunny skies are more frequent. Thatâ€™s the time when you want to taste the wild atlantic ocean and beat some waves. When it gets colder, walking on a lonely beach is an option. Never get tired of this view.</p>
